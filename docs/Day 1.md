When you create a fresh project, you will see a lot folders and files in your project. This might feel a little bit too much, the easiest way to get over it is to start with small changes and build on top of that. Over time everything will make more sense.

## Creating your first page

Gemi uses a declarative routing system where you define your routes with code instead of a file-system routing most popular frameworks like next.js use.

And the routes that render your page and api routes are defined separately `view.ts` and `api.ts` files where you defined them respectively. Both files are located in `/app/http/routes` directory.
