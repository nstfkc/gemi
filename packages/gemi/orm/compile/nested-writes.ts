/**
 * Nested writes: `connect` and shallow `create`, and nothing else.
 *
 * Which direction a nested write runs in is decided by *who holds the foreign
 * key*, and the two directions are genuinely different operations:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // this model holds organizationId — resolve the key, then insert once
 * User.create({ data: { email, organization: { connect: { id: 1 } } } })
 *
 * // Account holds userId — insert the user, then insert accounts pointing at it
 * User.create({ data: { email, accounts: { create: [{ ... }] } } })
 * ```
 *
 * The first is a `before` step (or, in the common case, no step at all — just a
 * column read straight out of the argument tree). The second is an `after` step,
 * because the key it needs does not exist until the parent row does.
 *
 * Everything else in Prisma's nested-write grammar — `connectOrCreate`, `set`,
 * `disconnect`, `update`, `upsert`, `delete`, `deleteMany`, `updateMany`,
 * `createMany` — throws `UnsupportedQueryError` naming the operation. Deep
 * nested writes carry real ordering and cascade semantics and are a feature in
 * their own right; smuggling half of them in here would mean shipping the
 * ordering bugs without the feature.
 *
 * NOT ATOMIC. See the note on `NestedWriteStep`: every step past the first is a
 * separate statement with no transaction around it until iteration 5.
